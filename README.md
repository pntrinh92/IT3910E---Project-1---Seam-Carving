# IT3910E---Project-1---Seam-Carving
The objective of this study is to utilize a seam carving algorithm to achieve content-aware image scaling and the seamless removal of specific objects. 
This approach enables image retargeting while preserving the integrity of semantic content, thereby avoiding the geometric distortion typically caused by standard scaling.
